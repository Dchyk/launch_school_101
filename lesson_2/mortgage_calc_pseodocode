GET loan_amount - ask for a float
- subroutine - check if the loan amount is a valid float or integer, and ask for 
  re-entry if it isn't

GET annual_percentage_rate - ask for a percentage in the form of a float less than 100

  re-entry if it isn't

GET loan_duration - ask for years
- subroutine - check if the the entry is a valid integer, and ask for   
  re-entry if it isn't

- divide the annual_percentage_rate (expressed as a percentage) by 12 to get the monthly_interest_rate

- divide the loan_duration by 12 to get the loan_duration_in_months - loan_months

SET monthly_payment = loan_amount * (monthly_interest_rate / (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate)**(-loan_duration_in_months)))

PRINT monthly_payment
